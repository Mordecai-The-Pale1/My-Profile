<p>    Hi my name is Daniel Thornton, I'm from Queensland Australia so I complain about how hot and sticky it is all the time.
  My education so far is not impressive, I graduated high school then went on to do a cabinet making trade, I have started
  an IT course in the pst but never completed it. I am determined this time however to complete a degree in IT and make a
  big change in my career. I have a wife, 4 children and 2 dogs, it gets so hectic in this house that I named our wirelss area network "The Looney Bin".
