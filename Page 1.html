<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
<div>
<p> My interest in IT is mostly the physical hardware technology. I find the developments in technology specifically hardware fascinating, the developments just in my life time have been huge. From our 386 as a kid, which is the first computer I remember seeing, to our state of the art IBM Aptiva in 1998 with a Pentium II at a mind blowing 266MHZ, then building my own PC’s as a teenager. I’d say my father is probably the reason I got interested in tech because he always wanted to upgrade the family computer so we usually had a pretty top end computer for the day, comparing those PC’s from nearly 30 years ago to my current Ryzen 5 system is a mind boggling level of advancement.</p>

<p>After starting to build and upgrade my own PC’s as a teenager I also built or upgraded computers for friends and family, which as usual ends leading to being the tech support guy for everyone in the family. I have also worked for a computer re-manufacturing and E-waste recycling company, where I was a re-marketer. The re-marketers would diagnose and repair where possible computers and other hardware, they were also responsible for the secure data erasure or destruction of the HDD depending on customer requirements. Generally the computers, servers and other IT equipment is business and government ex lease products from the major manufacturers such as Dell or HP.</p>

<p>After moving away from this line of work for personal reasons, I would like to get back into the IT industry in a more professional environment. Taking my skills into a professional environment realistically requires some level of study if I want to be successful. In the current global climate with covid 19 making online study and working from home more accepted and respected, I decided to look into online study as my current financial circumstances require me to also work full time. Rmit appear to have a good reputation and suited my needs, as well as offering the degree I believe to best secure the role in IT that I’m working towards.</p>
