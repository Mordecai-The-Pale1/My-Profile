    <h1> My Ideal Job </h1>
<div>
     <p>My ideal job in the it industry would be a Systems Engineer as this is a very hands on role. As a Systems Engineer you are responsible for the maintenance of current systems including troubleshooting and diagnostics, as well as the research, planning and implementation of future systems. With computer systems and particularly computer hardware being one the key reasons I am choosing a career in IT, a Systems Engineer is a very appealing role.

The responsibilities of a Systems engineer require areas of learning, skills and most importantly experience, including installing and configuring varying desktop and server hardware, setting up and maintaining backup software/hardware. As well as having experience with Windows desktop and server operating systems. These are skill I already posses however I need to build on these skills and experience by gaining more networking knowledge with VLANS, routing and firewalls, and by using and learning Windows server 2012r2 and 2016.

Upon completing a degree in IT with RMIT I will be in a good position to enter the IT industry as a junior System Administrator. As a System Administrator I will gain a majority of the experience with Windows server needed to progress into a Systems Engineering position, along with the networking experience and exposure to project management through the implementation of new systems. It will also provide good experience with VMWARE and resource management, as well as learning to understand the IT needs of businesses so as to plan for the implementation of future IT systems.
