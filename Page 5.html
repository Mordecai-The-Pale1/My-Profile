    <h1> Solar Powered Latte Panda based all in one computer </h1>
<div>
     <p>A complete all in one personal computer powered by the sun, using a Latte Panda as the brains of the computer and a solar panel as the power supply, a SPPC (solar powered PC) is the most efficient computer you can use anywhere.
      </p>

     <p>The personal computer is an office staple in business and education. The Covid19 pandemic caused a necessary and rapid shift to people working and learning from home. Many of the people who had to make the change to working/learning from home, needed to upgrade or purchase new computer systems or laptops. With the current costs or computers and laptops and latest supply chain shortages for hardware and components (www.thestreet.com,2020) the need for an affordable solution has never been bigger.
     </p>
     <p>While the Raspberry Pi is one of the most famous single-board computers the Latte Panda is the only development board that supports a complete windows 10 ecosystem (https://www.lattepanda.com, 2020). Having windows 10 as a platform for our all in one PC allows for a huge range of compatible software and driver support. With software and drivers being some of the least user friendly issues to troubleshoot when it comes to the less tech savvy customers.
     </p>
     <p>The Latte Panda will provide more than enough computing power with its Intel Cherry Trail Z8350 quad core processor running at up to 1.92 GHz, 4GB of DDR3L memory and 64GB of onboard storage, with Intel HD graphics. This is more than enough performance to run office suites, stream HD video and browse online content.
     </p>
     <p>Boasting onboard WIFI and Bluetooth 4.0, it has plenty of connectivity and the featured USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 expansion slots provide enough flexibility for this budget all in one computer. The onboard Bluetooth makes for perfect connectivity to the included Bluetooth Keyboard and mouse.
     </p>
     <p>With Flexibility being the selling point of this system, it will have an onboard battery with a dual DC power interface, one allowing the use of a standard power supply and one for use  by the included solar panel. The solar panel allows this computer to be used anywhere a laptop would be with ability to recharge via the power of the sun.
     </p>
     <p>The 15 inch 1080p FHD is a perfect entry size screen for the PC it also gives the sleek and stylish design while at the same time, allowing for future SKUs with bigger screens, more ram and more storage. This gives us the option to scale the product across multiple SKUs hitting multiple price points and positioning ourselves strongly according to competition.
     </p>
     <p>For whats required to build such a system, the Latte Panda makes the perfect base PC as each Panda already features a licensed, preinstalled copy of windows 10 which takes care of the essential software. To use a solar panel as a charging method, it will require an incorporated solar controller coupled with a sufficient dc power supply to handle both the solar controller and AC-DC mains power adaptor.
     </p>
     <p>Potential licensing issues between the Latte Panda itself and the Microsoft Windows 10 license being used commercially may arise, however this will require further research through a professional legal team with experience in copyright law, trademarks and licensing.
     </p>
     <p>To get this product into production it will have to go through several iterations of prototypes. The initial prototype can be build from off the shelf components virtually at a DIY level. Further prototyping will require hardware engineers with experience in solar power to incorporate the solar controller, and design an adequate delivery system. In addition to engineers there will need to be a design team to bring to market a sleek and stylish product, that is also rugged enough to be used anywhere.
     </p>
     <p>One of the great things about living in an age of technology such as we do is that if your idea is good enough, you can get a product backed by crowd funding on websites such as kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com, 2020) this has the added benefits of giving you an idea of how well your product can do when it goes to market. If this product is successful it will fill the void of affordable and yet powerful all in one PC, with similar all in one systems from competitors costing upwards of $900 (www.jbhifi.com.au, 2020). While at the same time using less energy and using green energy by simply putting the solar panel in a window. With solar energy becoming more and more affordable as time progresses, the possibilities for creating green energy powered technology are endless.
